## 1. Employee Class

Create a class called `Employee` that includes three instance variables—a `first name` (type String), a `last name` (type String) and a `monthly salary` (double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a `set` and a `get` method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, do not set its value. Write a test app named `EmployeeTest` that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two `Employee objects` and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.

## 2. File I/O

Create a class that does the following:
Create a file *“numbers.txt”*
Open the file and add 100 numbers into the file.
Create a second class that reads the file *“numbers.txt”* and prints the total of all 100 numbers.

## 3. Calculate Circumference 

`calcArea()` and `calcCircumference()`

Create two files. The first is the calculation file. The second is the test of the calculation file.

## 4. Class, subclass, toString() method

Create two subclasses of Animal: `LandAnimal` and `WaterAnimal`. Write a test class that creates one `LandAnimal` and one `WaterAnimal` and call their `toString()` methods.

## 5. Calculate current age

Get user's name and DOB. Print out the users full name and approximate age in years, months and days.

## 6. Exception files

   > arithmeticException
   > arrayindexOutOfBound
   > numberFormatException

## 7. File I/O

Create a java program that creates two files. Fill each file with 100 random integer numbers between 1 and 20.
Close the files. Open them again and determine if there are any numbers that are in both files. If there are matches display the number(s) matched.

## 8. Flight search

Ask the user to input a flight number. Look up the flight number in the first array. If the flight number is found display the departure and arrival times. If the flight number is not found tell the user there is no such flight and let them try again.

## 9. Environmental Control System for a house

Ask the user if they want to unlock the door, turn on the light, and what value the temperature should be.
Display the state of the door (locked or unlocked), the state of the lights (on or off) and the desired temperature and the current temperature. Ask the user if they want to make changes. If they do, loop back and ask for all three values again. If no changes are desired, end the program.

## 10. Quiz Game

The program will ask the user the first question.  The program will take the answer the user provides and check to see if they are right.
If they are right the program will generate another question. If they are wrong, it will give them one more try at that question then move on to the next question.
The program will ask a total of three questions.
After the three questions are asked, the program will display the results of number right and number wrong.

## 11. Search Array

Create an array of type int. Size of 5, fill with data. Ask the user for a number. Search your array to see if it is in the array. Tell the user the result.

## 12. Switch Case

Write an application that uses iteration and switch statements to print the song “The Twelve Days of Christmas.” One switch statement should be used to print the day (“first,” “second,” and so on). A separate switch statement should be used to print the remainder of each verse.

## 13. Temperature Conversion

An application that enables the user either to enter a `Fahrenheit` temperature and display the `Celsius` equivalent or to enter a `Celsius` temperature and display the `Fahrenheit` equivalent.

## 14. Practicing Array

   >  `display`
   > `sort`
   > `compare`
   > `find the largest value`

## 15. Find the minimum 

Write a method `minimum3` that returns the smallest of three floating-point numbers. Use the `Math.min` method to implement `minimum3`. Incorporate the method into an application that reads three values from the user, determines the smallest value and displays the result.

## 16. User Login

This is a login validation program. You will check for valid login id and matching password.

The user enters a login id. You check that id against a `String` array of valid ids. If it is not valid you tell them so and ask for a new login id. If the id is valid (it matches an ID in the array) then you ask them for a password. You check their entered password against an array of matching passwords. That is: the index number where you found the valid id needs to be used for the index to check the password. For example, if you found the valid id at position 3 in the id array, then you go to position 3 in the password array to see if it matches. If the password does not match, ask them to enter it again. If it does match tell them they have a successful login.
